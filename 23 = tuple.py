# tuple in python just like lists but there is some defirint betowen them :
#
# 1 ==> syntax
# 2 ==> speed (tuple is faster)
# 3 ==> cant change , update , delete values in tuple and becouse of this defirint some ones call tuple : immutable list
# 4 ==> tuple is more safe than list

newTuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 3, (4, 5, 2), 3, 3)
# print tuple items with for :

# for num in newTuple:
#     print(num)

# print("--------------------")
# # print tuple items with while :
# index = 0
# while index < len(newTuple):
#     print(newTuple[index])
#     index += 1
# print("--------------------")

# print(newTuple.index(3))
# print("---")
# print(newTuple.count(3))
# print("---")
# print(newTuple[5])
# print("---")
# print("---")
# print(newTuple[0:3])
# # note : if you dont khow whats is above function, go to 17
# # most fonction in list can use in tuple too
